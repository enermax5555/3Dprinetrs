# 3D printer models

WebSite for 3D printer models, where designers should have the apportunity to post their 3D models for free.

### The project is still in development and not working as it should be!!!

## What we got by now:
Created All the pages, with their styling.

Include some js for dynamic content.

## What we still need:
- Responsiveness is the first thing we should do. The site is not very responsive on moblile device.
- We need an auth system for users
  - Only authenticated users could upload a 3D models(but everyone should have the apportunity to download for free!)
- Auto genereting pages like:
  - Product section, where we list all the products posted by all members of the community.
  - Product details, where we give details about the 3D model and download option.
  - Contact form for feedback.
- SEO is hardly needed as well.
